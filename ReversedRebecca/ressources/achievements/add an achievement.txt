To add a new achievement, proceed as follows :
1 - copy the folder of an existing achievement
2 - paste it in in this very folder (the game will automatically detect it)
3 - rename that folder into a unique name (important for later)
4 - change files within that folder as desired (your image, your parameters, etc.)
5 - for every folder of "ressources/texts", open its "achievement.txt" file
6 - write the text of your achievement as it should be displayed in each language (the word in the very left part is the exact word used when naming the folder)

Congrats ! Your achievement is now a game achievement ! Now, you only need to create the unlocking condition in Piranha (see ACHIEVEMENT at "ressources/piranha doc/type de requêtes/requêtes ressources.txt").
This might be intimidating, but it's the only way to proceed.

Note : your custom achievements won't be licked to the steam achievement system. Only to the game's one.
