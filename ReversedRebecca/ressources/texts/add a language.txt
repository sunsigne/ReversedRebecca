To add a new language, proceed as follows :
1 - Copy the folder of an existing language.
2 - Paste it into this very folder (the game will automatically detect it).
3 - Rename your folder into the name of your language (optional).
4 - For every file contained within, translate each value after the "=" symbol.

That's it.

Note : the game cannot display more than 12 languages.
Note : during a dialogue, if you NEED a character to say %, write "0/0" instead : the game will convert it.
