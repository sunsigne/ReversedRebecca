To add a new language, proceed as follows :
1 - copy the folder of an existing language
2 - paste it in in this very folder (the game will automatically detect it)
3 - rename that folder into the name of your language (optional)
4 - for each file contained within, translate each value after the "=" symbole

That's it.

Note : the game cannot display more than 12 languages
