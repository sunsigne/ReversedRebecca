To add a new language, you can :
1 - copy the folder of an existing language
2 - paste it in in this very folder /texts (the game will automatically detect it)
3 - rename that folder into the name of your language (optional)
4 - translate every file contained within

That's it.

Note : the game cannot display more than 12 languages
