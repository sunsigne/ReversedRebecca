% HELLO
player = object = happy = Hi Camille, how are you?
object = DOWN = asleep = …
player = object = worry = Still… kinda "Robotic" ?
object = object = asleep = …
player = object = you_silly_var = That was a silly question…@ She won't answer:
player = object = camille = Sure thing! And you, Rebecca?@Still kinda "human"?
object = object = asleep = …
player = object = you_silly_var = "Make an intelligent robot"…@That’s quite a project you have there, Erika…
player = object = you_silly = I hope she doesn't push herself too much…


% SARAH_NOTICE
sarah = player = happy = By the way, I can't wait to see the result.
player = sarah = laugh = Yeah, me too!


% SARAH_REBECCA_HUMAN
sarah = player = happy_var = It's fascinating to see how much@she looks like a human being.
player = sarah = happy = Erika says it won't be just about@her looks.
player = sarah = happy_var = She will have such an advanced intelligence that@you won't even be able to tell the difference.
sarah = player = surprised = Really?
player = sarah = laugh = Yes. It's refreshing, don't you think?
sarah = player = worry = What do you mean?
player = sarah = happy = Mostly, when you deal with a software,@you can quickly point out its limits.
player = sarah = happy_var = Not this time! We will mainly be marveling@at its adaptiveness.
sarah = player = laugh = I get it!@It's a change, indeed.
player = DOWN = you_silly = Isn't it?


% SARAH_REBECCA_LIFE
player = sarah = happy = Did you ever wonder if robots were alive?
sarah = player = laugh = They wouldn't be robots anymore, though.
player = sarah = worry = I'm being serious.
player = sarah = happy = Here is my point : plants are alive.@But, they are so different from us…
player = sarah = happy_var = We can't just figure out how they do think.
player = sarah = happy = However, if plants are alive,@why rocks wouldn't be?
sarah = player = laugh = You mix everything up.@What is alive is what is breathing.
player = sarah = worry = If so, fire is alive…
sarah = player = happy = Fire doesn't breathe, Rebecca. It…
sarah = camille = fine = …
sarah = player = happy = It just transforms oxygene.
sarah = player = worry = Fine… In a way, it needs it to "live".
sarah = player = worry = And in another way, it does "eat" and "reproduce".
sarah = player = happy = But it does not think.@It's just fire.
player = sarah = worry = You can't tell if it does think or not.
player = sarah = happy = The thought among animals is just@a big electrical networks.
sarah = player = wink = A big electrical AND organic networks!@That is the difference.
player = sarah = laugh = Stop throwing out a new word without defining it@as soon as you want to justify your thinking.
player = sarah = happy = The organs are well-crafted machines.
player = sarah = happy = But the fundamental brick is the same@for everything : atoms.
player = sarah = laugh = Of course, we are way more complex than rocks.
player = sarah = happy = But… Maybe, they are primitive forms of life.
player = sarah = happy_var = And maybe the whole planet is alive,@and that we look primitive to it.
sarah = player = worry = Nah, that's too much…
sarah = camille = you_silly_var = …
sarah = player = happy = Yet, that's an interesting point of view.
sarah = player = happy_var = Even if I don't share it…
player = sarah = laugh = So much the better! That would be so boring@if we all were thinking the same way.
