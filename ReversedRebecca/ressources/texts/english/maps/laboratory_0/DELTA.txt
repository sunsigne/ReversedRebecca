rebecca = object = happy = Do you have any info on what just happened?
delta = rebecca = excited = Yes, I know everything.
rebecca = object = surprised = Really?
delta = rebecca = worry = No. But, I can guess the main points.
delta = rebecca = happy = A dawg broke in here, stole something, and left.@Am I right?
rebecca = object = laugh = Yes, kind of!
rebecca = object = worry = Yet, we don't know if he stole something.
delta = rebecca = wink = Believe my experience. Whoever it is,@he or she didn't leave empty-handed.
rebecca = object = happy_var = Ok. In this case, I need to find out what he took.
delta = rebecca = excited = Good luck, sis!


% THEFT
delta = rebecca = smile = No, I don't know what he took.@Otherwise, I would have told you.
rebecca = object = happy_var = Just wanted to be sure.


% KEY_EXIT
rebecca = object = laugh = Hi Delta!
delta = rebecca = happy = Yo, sis!@How can I help you?
rebecca = object = happy = Do you have any idea@how I can find us an outing?
delta = rebecca = no_sens = Hmm… I guess if you're asking,@it's because the front door is blocked.
rebecca = object = no_sens = Not just a little…@It is completely buried under rocks.
delta = rebecca = laugh = Hell! The pal went at it full force!
delta = rebecca = excited = If I were you, I would just stop by the reception.
rebecca = object = surprised = Ho! We do have that!
rebecca = object = worry = As we almost never receive the public,@I ended up forgetting that this room existed.
delta = rebecca = laugh = Come on, go save us, "miss adventurer".
rebecca = object = happy_var = Sure.


% KEY
rebecca = object = laugh = Hi Delta!
delta = rebecca = happy = Yo, sis!@How can I help you?
rebecca = object = happy = Do you know where the@keys to the next door are?
delta = rebecca = excited = I have a spare one, take it.
rebecca = object = happy_var = Thanks!


% THATS_CRAZY
rebecca = object = no_sens = How crazy it is,@this guy bursting in like that…
delta = rebecca = happy_var = Oh no! It's nothing new!
delta = rebecca = worry = You say that because you're not used to it.
delta = rebecca = laugh = But with my brother, we used to do@this kind of stuff all the time.
rebecca = object = surprised = What?!
delta = rebecca = worry = Don't worry. Nobody was hurt.
delta = rebecca = happy_var = We were just stealing cool stuff.


% THATS_NOT_COOL
delta = rebecca = worry = Hey! Everyone has their own past…
delta = rebecca = laugh = And then… Today, I didn’t do anything.
rebecca = object = worry = True enough.
rebecca = object = happy = Well, I better go.
delta = rebecca = wink = Good luck, sis.


% PAST
rebecca = object = happy = What exaclty were you doing with your brother?
delta = rebecca = happy = We would scout out a place with high-tech pieces,@break in, and then steal it.
rebecca = object = excited = … And then?
delta = rebecca = happy_var = Actually, that's it.@We ended up having a garage full of stuff.
rebecca = object = no_sens = You never used any of it?
delta = rebecca = laugh = Yes, as doorstops or as paperweights.
delta = rebecca = excited = It was the theft itself that was interesting.
delta = rebecca = worry = To us, it was always just junk.@We never understood what it was for.
rebecca = object = happy = Yet today, you are an engineer!@You should understand easily now.
delta = rebecca = wink = Yeah, but in the meantime, my brother@and I went our separate ways.
delta = rebecca = smile = He kept his love for "raids",@and I kept my love of technology.
delta = rebecca = worry = And since I settled down and he didn't,@it made sense that he kept the garage.
delta = rebecca = happy_var = But I have fond memories of it. And if I had@the chance to do it all over again, I'd sign up right away!
rebecca = object = laugh = Yes, that's the impression you give.
rebecca = object = happy = Alright, I'm off.
delta = rebecca = excited = Take care, sis.










% JUST_CHECKING
rebecca = object = worry = Just to be sure… It wasn't your brother who did it today, was it?
delta = rebecca = laugh_var = Ha ha ha ha!
delta = rebecca = wink = No. He knows where I work. He wouldn't do that to me. Trust me, it was 100"0/0" not him.
rebecca = object = laugh = Ok, if you say so.


% SOUNDS_FUN
delta = rebecca = excited = That's "heavy cool" you mean!
delta = rebecca = laugh = But hey, it's behind all that…@Today, I settled down.
rebecca = object = happy = Why did you stop?
delta = rebecca = no_sens = To make it short: @my brother is an addict.
delta = rebecca = happy = We ended up breaking up, and I couldn't see myself continuing without him. So, I stopped.
rebecca = object = you_silly_var = I see.
rebecca = object = happy = Well, I better go.
delta = rebecca = wink = Good luck, big girl.


% ADDICT
rebecca = object = worry = It’s probably personal but…@Is your brother okay then?
delta = rebecca = no_sens = Well yes, why?
rebecca = object = unhappy = I don’t know… You said he was an addict.
delta = rebecca = surprised = Ho! I'm there! Do you think @I'm talking about drugs or alcohol.
delta = rebecca = laugh_var = Ha ha ha ha!
delta = rebecca = happy = He is addicted to games.
delta = rebecca = wink = For him, all of life is a playground.
delta = rebecca = worry = And like a game without risk, it's not fun, @he wanted us to always take more risks.
delta = rebecca = no_sens = I have nothing against a little challenge, but@it was becoming more and more dangerous.
delta = rebecca = happy = I preferred to stop before we started having real problems. 
delta = rebecca = happy_var = But I have good memories of it. And if I had to do it again, I'd sign right away!
rebecca = object = laugh = Yes, that's the impression you give.
rebecca = object = happy = Okay, I'm going.
delta = rebecca = excited = Looking forward to it, my dear.


% FIRSTNAME
delta = rebecca = happy = Yes?
rebecca = object = happy = I was thinking…@That’s a funny name “Delta”. Don't you think so?
rebecca = object = worry = No offense.
delta = rebecca = laugh = No harm done. Yes, it's not common, indeed.@My parents have a thing with the Greek alphabet.
delta = rebecca = smile = And you, where does “Rebecca” come from?
rebecca = object = worry = In truth, the choice of my first name is not a very interesting story…
rebecca = object = excited = But, I like to imagine that I have the same name as a star!
delta = rebecca = surprised = There is a star called "Rebecca"?
rebecca = object = laugh = No. But it could.
delta = rebecca = wink = In that case, let me know if tomorrow,@they call a star "Delta".
rebecca = object = happy_var = I take note of this.
rebecca = object = happy = Okay, I'll get started.
delta = rebecca = laugh = Yes, yes… It's not like this is @the fourth time you've said that.

rebecca = object = happy = Delta?
delta = rebecca = laugh = Alala! Your poor investigation will remain unresolved for a long time, it seems!
rebecca = object = happy_var = You must believe that I like you.
rebecca = object = happy = More seriously. Do you have any idea what the intruder took?
delta = rebecca = no_sens = No. I don't know anything about it.
delta = rebecca = excited = If I were you, I'd try to trace his path.@That might help.
rebecca = object = happy_var = Yes, I had this idea in the back of my mind.
delta = rebecca = laugh = Come on, go investigate, “madam inspector”.
rebecca = object = happy_var = Yes, this time I'm really getting into it.

delta = rebecca = laugh = Alala! This poor door will stay closed for a long time, it seems!
rebecca = object = happy_var = You must believe that I like you.
rebecca = object = happy = More seriously. Do you have any idea@how I find us an outing?
delta = rebecca = happy_var = Not by standing here talking to me, yet.
rebecca = object = laugh = I suspect so,@but do you have a more general suggestion?
delta = rebecca = no_sens = Hmm… I guess if you're asking,@it's because the front door is blocked.
rebecca = object = no_sens = The word is weak… She is completely@buried under the rocks.
delta = rebecca = laugh = Oh yeah! The guy didn't pretend!
delta = rebecca = excited = If I were you, I would just stop by the reception.
rebecca = object = surprised = Ho! It’s true that we have that!
rebecca = object = worry = As we almost never receive an audience, @I ended up forgetting that this room existed.
delta = rebecca = laugh = Come on, go save us, “madam adventurer”.

delta = rebecca = excited = Of course! What's the problem?
rebecca = object = unhappy = You're going to find this stupid, but…@All these offices confuse me…
delta = rebecca = laugh_var = Are you serious?
delta = rebecca = excited = Ok, I'll give you an overview: this is the research center.
delta = rebecca = smile = We have offices, and at the end of the corridor,@a super cool break room.
delta = rebecca = smile = On the right, it's the development center: @more offices, and the "big laboratory".
