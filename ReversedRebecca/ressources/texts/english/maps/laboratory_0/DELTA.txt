rebecca = object = surprised = Really?
delta = rebecca = worry = No. But, I can guess the main points.
delta = rebecca = happy = A dawg broke in here, stole something, and left.@Am I right?
rebecca = object = laugh = Yes, kind of!
rebecca = object = worry = Yet, we don't know if he stole something.
delta = rebecca = wink = Trust my experience. Whoever it was,@he or she didn't leave empty-handed.
rebecca = object = happy_var = Ok. In this case, I need to find out what he took.
delta = rebecca = excited = Good luck, sis!


% THEFT
delta = rebecca = smile = No, I don't know what he took.@Otherwise, I would have told you.

rebecca = object = happy = Do you have any idea@how I can find us an outing?
delta = rebecca = no_sens = Hmm… I guess if you're asking,@the front door is blocked.
rebecca = object = no_sens = Blocked is an understatement…@It is completely buried under rocks.
delta = rebecca = laugh = Hell! That pal went at it full force!
delta = rebecca = excited = If I were you, I would just stop by the reception.
rebecca = object = surprised = Ho! We do have that!
rebecca = object = worry = Since we almost never get visitors,@I ended up forgetting that this room existed.
delta = rebecca = laugh = Go on, go save us, "miss adventurer".
rebecca = object = happy_var = Sure.


% KEY
rebecca = object = laugh = Hi Delta!
delta = rebecca = happy = Yo, sis!@How can I help you?

delta = rebecca = excited = I've got a spare, take it.
rebecca = object = happy_var = Thanks!


% THATS_CRAZY
rebecca = object = no_sens = How crazy it is,@this guy bursting in like that…
delta = rebecca = happy_var = Oh no! It's nothing new!
delta = rebecca = worry = You say that because you're not used to it.
delta = rebecca = laugh = But my brother and I used to do@this kind of stuff all the time.
rebecca = object = surprised = What?!
delta = rebecca = worry = Don't worry. Nobody was hurt.
delta = rebecca = happy_var = We were just stealing cool stuff.


% THATS_NOT_COOL
delta = rebecca = worry = Hey! Everyone has their own past…
delta = rebecca = laugh = And then… Today, I didn’t do anything.
rebecca = object = worry = True enough.
rebecca = object = happy = Well, I better go.
delta = rebecca = wink = Good luck, sis.


% PAST
rebecca = object = happy = What exaclty were you doing with your brother?
delta = rebecca = happy = We would scout out a place with high-tech pieces,@break in, and then steal it.
rebecca = object = excited = … And then?
delta = rebecca = happy_var = Actually, that's it.@We ended up having a garage full of stuff.
rebecca = object = no_sens = You never used any of it?
delta = rebecca = laugh = We did, as doorstops or as paperweights.
delta = rebecca = excited = It was the thrill of the heist that was interesting.
delta = rebecca = worry = To us, it was always just junk.@We never understood what it was for.
rebecca = object = happy = Yet today, you are an engineer!@You should understand easily now.
delta = rebecca = wink = Yeah, but in the meantime, my brother@and I have taken our own paths.
delta = rebecca = smile = He kept his love for "raids",@and I kept my love of technology.
delta = rebecca = worry = And since I settled down and he didn't,@it made sense that he kept the garage.
delta = rebecca = happy_var = But I have fond memories of it. And if I had@the chance to do it all over again, I'd sign up right away!
rebecca = object = laugh = Yes, that's the impression you give.
rebecca = object = happy = Alright, I'm off.
delta = rebecca = excited = Take care, sis.


% JUST_CHECKING
rebecca = object = worry = Just to be sure… It's not your brother@who pulled the stunt today, is it?
delta = rebecca = laugh_var = Ha ha ha ha!
delta = rebecca = wink = No. He knows where I work. He wouldn't do that to me. Trust me, it was 100"0/0" not him.
rebecca = object = laugh = Ok, if you say so.


% SOUNDS_FUN
delta = rebecca = excited = That's "heavy cool" you mean!
delta = rebecca = laugh = But hey, it's all in the past…@Today, I've settled down.
rebecca = object = happy = Why did you stop?
delta = rebecca = no_sens = To make it short: @my brother is an addict.
delta = rebecca = happy = We ended up breaking up, and I couldn't see myself continuing without him. So, I quit.
rebecca = object = you_silly_var = I see.
rebecca = object = happy = Well, I better go.
delta = rebecca = wink = Good luck, sis.


% ADDICT
rebecca = object = worry = It's probably personal but…@Is your brother okay then?
delta = rebecca = no_sens = Well, yeah, why?
rebecca = object = unhappy = I don't know… You said he was an addict.
delta = rebecca = surprised = Ho! I see! You think@I'm talking about drugs or alcohol.
delta = rebecca = laugh_var = Ha ha ha ha!
delta = rebecca = happy = He is addicted to games.
delta = rebecca = wink = For him, life is one big playground.
delta = rebecca = worry = And since a game without risk its't fun, @he always wanted us to take more risks.
delta = rebecca = no_sens = I don't mind a little challenge, but@it was getting more and more dangerous.
delta = rebecca = happy = I preferred to quit before@we started having real problems. 
delta = rebecca = happy_var = But I have fond memories of it. And if I had@the chance to do it all over again, I'd sign up right away!
rebecca = object = laugh = Yes, that's the impression you give.
rebecca = object = happy = Alright, I'm off.
delta = rebecca = excited = Take care, sis.


% FIRSTNAME
delta = rebecca = happy = Yes?
rebecca = object = happy = I was thinking…@"Delta" is an odd name. Don't you think so?
rebecca = object = worry = No offense.
delta = rebecca = laugh = No offense taken. Yes, it's definitively uncommon.@My parents have a thing with the Greek alphabet.
delta = rebecca = smile = And you, where does "Rebecca" come from?
rebecca = object = worry = To be honest, the story behind my name isn't very interesting…
rebecca = object = excited = But, I like to imagine that I share the same name as a star!
delta = rebecca = surprised = There is a star named "Rebecca"?
rebecca = object = laugh = No. But there could be.
delta = rebecca = wink = In that case, let me know if tomorrow,@they name a star "Delta".
rebecca = object = happy_var = I'll keep that in mind.
rebecca = object = happy = Okay, I'll get started.
delta = rebecca = laugh = Yes, yes… It's not like this is@the fourth time you've said that.

rebecca = object = happy = Seriously though. Do you have any idea what the intruder took?
delta = rebecca = no_sens = No. I don't know anything about it.
delta = rebecca = excited = If I were you, I’d try to retrace his steps.@That might help.
rebecca = object = happy_var = Yes, I had this idea in the back of my mind.

rebecca = object = happy = Seriously though. Do you have any idea@how I find us an outing?
delta = rebecca = happy_var = Not by standing here talking to me, for sure.
rebecca = object = laugh = I figured,@but do you have a more general suggestion?
delta = rebecca = no_sens = Hmm… I guess if you're asking,@the front door is blocked.
rebecca = object = no_sens = Blocked is an understatement…@It is completely buried under rocks.
delta = rebecca = laugh = Hell! That pal went at it full force!

delta = rebecca = laugh_var = Are you serious?
delta = rebecca = excited = Ok, I'll give you an overview: here is the research area.
delta = rebecca = smile = We have offices, and at the end of the hallway,@there'a a super cool break room.
delta = rebecca = smile = To the right, it's the development area: @more offices, and the "big laboratory".
delta = rebecca = wink = And in between, the reception for tourists.

delta = rebecca = laugh_var = Really?
