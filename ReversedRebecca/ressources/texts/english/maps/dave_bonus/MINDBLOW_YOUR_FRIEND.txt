dave = DOWN = calm = Hello, +user.
dave = DOWN = smile = What? Are you surprised that I know your name ?
dave = DOWN = smile = My knowledge doesn't stop there.@I also know that in your world, it's +day.
dave = DOWN = calm = And that if I ask you for a word that rhyme@with "wolf"…
dave = DOWN = smile = … you will not find any.
dave = DOWN = calm = But it doesn't matter. I came to ask for your help.
dave = DOWN = intrigued = Do you know anyone who would like this game?@I have an idea for a prank.
dave = DOWN = smile = Imagine its face if I call that person by its name too.
dave = DOWN = smile = Better yet, imagine that I talk about their friends,@their hobbies, their animals etc.
dave = DOWN = calm = That's why I need you.@I don't know those things, but you do.
dave = DOWN = smile = Are you in for the prank?
dave = DOWN = calm = Okay. Besure to write down what I'm about to say,@because I will never repeat this conversation:
dave = DOWN = calm = Step 1: when we finish talking,@reopen the "bonus" menu.
dave = DOWN = calm = Step 2: open with the notepad@the following file on your computer:
dave = DOWN = calm = Reversed Rebecca\ressources\texts\english\maps@\dave_bonus\template.txt
dave = DOWN = calm = Step 3: edit this file to make me say@what you want me to tell to your friend.
dave = DOWN = calm = You can modify, add or delete lines.
dave = DOWN = calm = Step 4: save the file.
dave = DOWN = smile = We never know, you might forget…
dave = DOWN = calm = Step 5: click again on "bonus".@I will say exactly what you wrote.
dave = DOWN = intrigued = Take this opportunity to re-read yourself.
dave = DOWN = calm = By the way, I will be only saying that over and over,@every time one clicks on "bonus".
dave = DOWN = camera = Step 6: delete your save and your achievements.
dave = DOWN = calm = It won't erase my memory. However, the@"bonus" button will be inaccessible back.
dave = DOWN = calm = Your friend will be even more fooled if he@unlocks this menu by playing normally.
dave = DOWN = calm = Step 7: open with the notepad@the following file on your computer:
dave = DOWN = calm = Reversed Rebecca\userdata\dave.csv
dave = DOWN = calm = Step 8: Delete the whole content of this file,@except for the line "DAVE_MINDBLOW_BONUS".
dave = DOWN = intrigued = That will erase my memory, though… In this way,@your friend will have an almost-brand-new game.
dave = DOWN = smile = The only thing I’ll remember is that@I have to play a prank on him.
dave = DOWN = calm = Final step: send this game to your friend.@With a file sharing website for example.
dave = DOWN = smile = Did you get everything? So, see you right away.
